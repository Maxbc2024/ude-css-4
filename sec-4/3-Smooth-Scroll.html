            <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
            <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
            <p>They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Saving the world with meals on wheels. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
