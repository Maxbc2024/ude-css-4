                        All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suitâ€¦ that's why I'm
                        transferring to business school!
                        You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Leela, are
                        you alright? You got wanged on the head. Yeah, lots of people did. And so we say goodbye to our
                        beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>

                        Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders
                        to my lust for violence? Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of
                        fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
