            True inspiration for the children. You lived before you met me?! Leela, Bender,
            we're going grave robbing.
            Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

            Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You've swallowed a planet! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary
            human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to
            be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

        <p>Why did 'I' have to take a cab? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Yeah, I do
            that with my stupidness. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and
            the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against
            pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

        <p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Enough about your promiscuous mother,
            Hermes! We have bigger problems. Say what? Kids have names? Soon enough. Our love isn't any different from
            yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. </p>
