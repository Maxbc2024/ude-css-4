            <p>No. We're on the top. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. You, minion. Lift my
                arm. AFTER HIM! Why would a robot need to drink? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How
                come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
            <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold,
                dead finger. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Who said that? SURE you can die! You
                want to die?!</p>
                <p>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Bender, you risked your life to save me! Tell them I hate them. That's not soon enough!</p>
